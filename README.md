# catgram
Basic tools for working with categorial grammars

This is a simple Python package providing some basic tools for working with
categorial grammars.
Development is on-again, off-again.
Issues and requests welcome!

## Requirements

* Python 3.10+
* `lambda_calculus` Python package (will be installed automatically by `pip`
  command below)

## Installation

In your environment of choice:
```shellsession
$ pip3 install catgram
```

## TODO

* Tests
* Better documentation, I guess...
    * Examples
* Other tools that might be useful?
    * Evaluation scripts (e.g., for evaluating statistical parsers)
    * Visualization tools (CCG dependency graphs, LCG term graphs; outputs to
      SVG, LaTeX...)
